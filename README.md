# TMW - Code Challenge - Senior Front-end

## The challenge?

Create a simple weather Javascript/HTML/CSS app that shows the current weather conditions for the user's current location. Please use the API at Open Weather Map.

## Implementation

I've implemented the challenge using the following API's:

- http://www.openweathermap.org
- http://sunrise-sunset.org/api
- http://maps.googleapis.com/maps/api/geocode/json
- navigator.geolocation

Please feel free to test the functionality by allowing and blocking the location request.
